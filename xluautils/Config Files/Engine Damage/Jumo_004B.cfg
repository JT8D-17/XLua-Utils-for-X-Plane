# XLua Utils engine profile generated on 02.11.2023, 02:11:10
#
# This file contains engine parameter data for XLua Util's engine damage module.
# The initial values were determined from the default datarefs, i.e. the aircraft's ACF file.
# You can override the default values with custom ones here and enable/disable single parameters.
# The new values will then be used after reloading the file from the "Engine Damage" menu in XLua Utils.
#
# Format for the damage-related parameters:
# ID, Enabled, base parameter redline (-1 = use dataref val), unit, base redline scalar to calculate damage accumulation rate from, base limit damage tolerance (in seconds), damage tolerance at node calculated from base redline * scalar (in seconds), scalar for damage rate when damage is receding.
