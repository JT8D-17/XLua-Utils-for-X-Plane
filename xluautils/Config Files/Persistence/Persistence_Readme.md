This folder contains dataref files for XLuaUtils' persistence utility for various aircraft.

&nbsp;

## Installation

To install, copy and paste the file for the aircraft in question to the _"[Aircraft root folder]/plugins/xlua/scripts/xluautils"_ and rename it to _persistence_datarefs.cfg_.   
After that, the file can be used by the persistence module as described in the main XLuaUtils manual.

If there is a sub-folder for an aircraft add-on in this folder, check it for any enclosed supplementary readme file as it will contain important additional information.
