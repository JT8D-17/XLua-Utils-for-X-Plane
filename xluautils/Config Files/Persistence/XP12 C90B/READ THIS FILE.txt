The custom datarefs created in the xlua scripts of this aircraft are created as non-writable, preventing them being written to by the persistence module.
Therefore, xlua/init.lua must be edited.

1. Make a backup of xlua/init.lua
2. In xlua/init.lua, find the code block starting with "function create_dataref(name,type,notifier)".
3. A few lines below, there will be this line: "dref = XLuaCreateDataRef(name,type,"no",nil)".
4. Replace the "no" with "yes", i.e: "dref = XLuaCreateDataRef(name,type,"yes",nil)".
5. Save and close init.lua. All custom datarefs created by this aircraft are now writable.
