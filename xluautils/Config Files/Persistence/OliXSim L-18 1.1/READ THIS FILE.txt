The custom datarefs created in the xlua scripts of the L-18 are created as non-writable, preventing them being written to by the persistence module. The enclosed modified init.lua for XLua 1.0 provides a workaround.

Installation:
Make a backup of xlua/init.lua and replace it with the one from this folder!
