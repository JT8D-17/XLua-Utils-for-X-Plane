This folder contains dataref files for XLuaUtils' persistence utility for various aircraft.

&nbsp;

To install, copy and paste the file for the aircraft in question to the _"[Aircraft root folder]/plugins/xlua/scripts/xlua_utils"_ and rename it to _datarefs.cfg_.   
After that, the persistence module can be initialized as per the main XLuaUtils manual.

&nbsp;

If there is a subfolder for an aircraft add-on in this folder, check it for any enclosed supplementary readmes.

&nbsp;

Contributiing _dataref.cfg_ files for other aircraft is appreciated.
